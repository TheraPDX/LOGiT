LogIt backlog


1. make add new Plant screen default - remove code that brings up all log objects by default (make this a selection from the popup menu?)
2. comment out listing of plants code in this view until activated by popup 
3. remove menu system
4. add new plant screen needs to be 3 screens and final screen has function that is currently applied to the "Add" button
5. auto save date/time stamp in each log entry
6. remove display of all plants at bottom of add new plant view
7. when strain is selected dereference possible effects for that strain and let the user select from that list? (make see all an option?) - this might save time
