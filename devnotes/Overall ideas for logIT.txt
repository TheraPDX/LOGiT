Overall ideas for logIT

1. main object is either the plant or the log

2. if we make the plant the main object, each plant has a profile in local storage which represents the evolution of that plant from when it was planted till the current day and time


3. if we make the log the main object, the log has information associated with each day for each plant 
	.a growLog contains a history about the plant(s) you are growing
		think of the plantHistory is a series of snapshots representing the currentStatus of each room and plant based on the data available
	
		snapShots can be viewed in various ways to support several userPerspectives
		- quickOverviewFromStart ("startDate", "todaysDate")
		- overviewByStage ("currentStage")
		- weeklyOverview ("currentWeek")
		- today ("todaysDate")    

	.each userPerspective supports a need a user would have when reviewing their logs
		- hows my garden doing as of today?
		- what has happened this week?
		- how is a specific plant doing?
		- if a problem is happening what has been done about it
		- what stage are my plants in
			- when was the last time they were fed and watered
			- when is the next time they need to be fed and watered
		- how do they look
		- in the currentStage, how are they in comparison to each other
		- how should myFavoriteStrains make me feel
		- once they are inUse, how did it actually make me feel
		- once they are inUse, how does that compare to the published expectations
		- how did this strain make others feel (?) 
		- when I want the same effects again I want to easily find which strain to pick
