Diet Duggestions
Eat more of a plant based diet in their natural and unrefined forms
fruits
vegetables
whole grains
legumes
soy products

Why?
1. Low in disease causing substances
2. High in disease preventing substances
3. avoid too many refined carbs and sugar (we need the fiber in the whole grain and brown rice)
4. Sugar in liquid form allows you to comnsume almost unlimited calories from sugar compared to fruit which fills you up before you consume too much
