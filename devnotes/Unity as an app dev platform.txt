Unity as an app dev platform

1. great for screen by screen animation of object to object interaction
2. not great for access to platform specific functions (ios/android photos, ui elements etc)
3. strives to run at max frameworks at all times even when no events are occuring so battery power takes a hit
4. not really designed with UI in mind so more code may have to be written to compensate
5. web based frameworks are more efficient since the user is only using a "web browser" which most phones can run anyway
6. mainly designed for constant motion and interaction between objects

This makes it a possibility for:
1. multimedia
2. childrens books
3. games
4. navigable environments
