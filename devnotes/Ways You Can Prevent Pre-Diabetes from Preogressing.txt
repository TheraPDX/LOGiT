Note: If you have prediabetes, healthy lifestyle choices can help you bring your blood sugar level back to normal or at least keep it from rising toward the levels seen in type 2 diabetes. Some people will progress to type 2 diabetes even if they lose weight

1. Eating healthy foods
-Choose foods low in fat and calories and high in fiber
-Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains
-Strive for variety to help you achieve your goals without compromising taste or nutrition
-This type of diet may be referred to as a Mediterranean-style diet

2. Getting more physical activity
-Aim for 30 to 60 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week
-Try not to let more than two days go by without some exercise

Some ideas for exersize:
-Take a brisk daily walk
-Ride your bike
-Swim laps
-The American Diabetes Association also recommends resistance training, such as weightlifting, twice a week
 
 Note: If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions spread throughout the day

3. Losing excess pounds
-If you're overweight, losing just 5 to 10 percent of your body weight — only 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms) — can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes

Note: To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits.

Note: Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight: a healthier heart, more energy, improved self-esteem

4. Taking medications as needed
-Sometimes the oral diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage) may be recommended by your doctor if you're at high risk of diabetes
-Though they won't help prevent diabetes, medications to control cholesterol and high blood pressure also may be prescribed when needed
