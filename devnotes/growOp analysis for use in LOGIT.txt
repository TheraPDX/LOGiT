growOp analysis for use in LOGIT


1. plantAddView = new log view
  **use this as the main new log screen when the plus butn is tapped

  -use user selected values instead of form based input to assign variables based on selection from subScreen (ingestion method, efffects, taste)

 2. plantView = this is the actual log screen where you can see and overview of the logs that have been created

 3. plantViewCtrl.js
  **leverage this to create and store the log object

 4. make plant add view the default view instead of inputPlantDet.html to make adding a log the main focus

 5. remove references to the slide out menu, not needed

 6. use close function attached to minus sign on plantAddView to close subviews and return to a former view (currently plantView.html)

 7. automatically timestamp each log entry for later use in trend analysis and weekly reviews

 8. use image based display approach in Tempz for main display of ingestion method, effect, flavor (or optimize to retrieve from localObject)
