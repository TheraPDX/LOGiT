LogIt - dev strategy

1. make the log the central storage object
+ adds each new log with data attached to it (one piece of which is the profile name)effects and -taste are filters in the logs and if not foudn there in the strains json object effect attribute
-possibly create two new arrays to contain the effect and taste attributes to speed up response
example: 
{
  "strainName" : "Jack Herer",
  "effects" : {"energetic", "creative", "productive"}
},
{
  "strainName" : "Girl Scout Cookies",
  "effects" : {"peaceful", "giggly", "hungry"}
}



proposed flow - 
main choices would be: 

+log 
- adds an entry to the current users log

choose an effect 
- lets the user select a desired effect and the app will 

choose a flavor - personal logs searched first, then default db
- lets the user select a desired flavor - personal logs searched first, then default db
