Notes About What Diabetes Is and How It Occurs

1. family history and genetics appear to play an important role (some genes that are related to insulin resistance)
2. Excess fat — especially abdominal fat — and inactivity also seem to be important factors in the development of prediabetes
3. people who have prediabetes aren't quite processing sugar (glucose) properly anymore
4. Most of the glucose in your body comes from the foods you eat, specifically foods that contain carbohydrates
5. Any food that contains carbohydrates can affect your blood sugar levels, not just sweet foods
6. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas
7. When you have prediabetes, this process begins to work improperly. Instead of fueling your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream
8. This occurs when your pancreas doesn't make enough insulin or your cells become resistant to the action of insulin or both
